# Hiding Access Patterns
The working code for the Oblivious RAM project I worked on over the Summer.

## Path ORAM
An implementation of Path ORAM was written in C++. Files can be stored in an encrypted ORAM, and retrieved at a later date.

## Randomisation Agent
A visualisation of the Randomisation Agent we were working on. It simulates accesses to data stored in an RA, showing the state of the disk as they happen.

The visualisation was written in Lua using the [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) library.

### Building
To run the visualisation, run:
```
love lua/
```
